### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Carlos Eulogio!

- **ðŸ”­** From May to October 2021, I had been an active contributor to the open-source finite element framework [Kratos Multiphysics](https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics/Kratos). Kratos is written in C++, with an extensive Python interface. It is available for Linux, Windows and MacOS and provides support for OpenMP and MPI parallelization.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on software development projects, ideally in numerical simulation/finite elements, but I am quite open.
